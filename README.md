This project demostrates akka's missing capability of recording full http response time

After cloning the project, put a file in the project folder, and name it `foo`.

use sbt to start the server
```bash
./sbt # enters sbt shell
reStart # starts the server
```

you can hit the server via http://localhost:8080/foo
